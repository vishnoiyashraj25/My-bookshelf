# Book Shelf App

This is a Responsive React application that allows users to search for books using the Open Library API and maintain a personal bookshelf in the browser using localStorage.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application locally, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager, installed with Node.js)

## Setting up the Project Locally

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/book-shelf-app.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd book-shelf-app

3. Install the required dependencies:
   npm install

## Running the Application

After setting up the project locally, you can run the application with the following steps:

1. Start the development server:
   npm start
   This command will start the development server and automatically open the application in your default web browser. If it doesn't open automatically, you can access it by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.
   
2. The application will hot-reload any changes you make to the code, so you can see the updates in real-time without having to restart the server.

3. To stop the development server, simply press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where the server is running.

## Building for Production

To create an optimized production build of the application, run the following command:
   npm run build
   This command will create a `build` folder in the project directory with the optimized and minified files ready for deployment.
